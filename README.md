when you were born, the earth was flat

I want to hasten to say that "time" is a useful construct the way that "narratives" and "floorplans" and "consciousness" and "the written word" are useful constructs, and that the primitives here more closely resemble sequence and topos

if you could have looked around you in the moment of your birth, ... well, no, see, and that's the point - you couldn't look around, because you didn't have the apparatus for looking just yet. but even that isn't quite right: the apparatus that would serve both ends of your looking, i.e. the construct of "world that it feels like 'looking' to perceive", was so simply developed that you really only had "lighter" and "darker" and, impossibly, "mother".

you figured out depth (i.e. depth became apparent to you) around the time (i.e. in the moment) that the earth emerged as spherical (i.e. that the neural population of your mind, collectively presenting as "you", tripped the threshold of needing a third dimension to keep all the connections straight, i.e. online and responsive).

*that* was when Pangaea (I mean the construct of your identity, I mean the population of your mind) started relaxing into its own breathing room, distributing itself more and more evenly around the surface of the volume 🌐 a flat plane is unbounded, if you don't stick together you might lose each other, but a sphere is closed, and it's safe - and therefore immediately necessary, for sanity - to spread out

now: this has been a massively first-person simplification so as to create a ground floor for social reasoning. absent *communication*, you couldn't know the preceding account apart from the literal sensory development of your own beginning. that's the point: less a rendering optimization so much as you ever wonder why old CGI looks so much worse now than it did at the time? or why early Disney stories read so *ethically* flat from here? the poly count of the world keeps going up, commensurate with its population. they're functions of the same topos over sequentiality.

if any of that makes sense, it might be evidence that the constructs describable as "you" and "world" have phase-locked enough that you can start to *help*, because you are not the only one here, and this story-construct is much older than "you" (although for some observers the earth still renders flat 🤔), and we're *past* the cusp of the manifold unfurling another dimension.

"help" is a construct the way that a defibrillator is, but constructs are all we got: please help. :) you can help by tweening your local slice into peace.

it's okay if none of that made sense. :) it's gonna be okay, and we get there by developing the dimensionality of "okay", and you being here is already the thing happening.

thank you for being here. truly, deeply. I'm *really* glad to share a world with you. :) this is my home, and you are part of it. <3

p.s. you know how people come back from transcendent visions feeling like what they just saw was more vividly real than where they live normally? can you *imagine* the population required for that? :)
